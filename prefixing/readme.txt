Prefixing means to add an operator BEFORE the variable, such as:

++Counter;

Postfixing means to add an operator AFTER the variable, such as:

Counter++;

Used acutely, these do the same thing, adding a single count to Counter.
However, when used in more complex calculations, adding 1 to Counter before or after an imminent
calculation can change the resulting outcome.
